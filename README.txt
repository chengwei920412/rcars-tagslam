* General Information *

RCARS (Robot-Centric Absolute Reference System) is a ROS Metapackage
that provides a lightweight and easy to use, visual inertial state
estimation and/or motion capture system. It uses a Simultaneous
Localization And Mapping (SLAM) approach based on aritificual
landmarks ("fiducials") observed by a camera and inertial measurement
data retrieved from an IMU. Yet, the system is still fast and easily
integratable into existing systems.

* Publication * 

There is a scientific publication describing the implemented
approach. In case RCARS is useful for you, please consider citing the

* Support *

We try to provide as much support as possible. However, please note
that we are a research lab and thus have limited capacity. In case
there are issues with the software, please consider opening an issue
here on Bitbucket. That we, we can interact with you easily and other
users running into similar issues can read up on possible solutions.
